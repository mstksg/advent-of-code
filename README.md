Advent of Code
==============

It's the most wonderful time of the year!

This is my mega-repo of [Advent of Code][] solutions here, along with an
automated fetching, testing, running environment (powered by the
*[advent-of-code-api][]* library). So far only Haskell solutions are here, but
maybe more will come later?
