This one was definitely a bit too heavy on the parsing side heh. But maybe the
more interesting Haskell insight would be that we can use a nice data type --
`V3` from the *linear* library (`data V3 a = V3 a a a`) to make the actual
solving logic very simple.  I've always held that `V2` and `V3` are pretty much
some of the most useful non-standard data types for advent of code, and they
were pretty helpful today.  They have the most convenient `Num`, `Functor`,
`Applicative`, `Foldable`, and `Traversable` instances!

If we encode each "set" as `V3 <red> <green> <blue>`, then the filters and
checksums become very simple.

For part 1, we need to see if all `V3 Int`s in a line are legal.  We can
implement that as `all isLegal`:

```hasell
isLegal :: V3 Int -> Bool
isLegal colorVec = and do
  allowed <- V3 12 13 14
  amount <- colorVec
  pure (amount <= allowed)
```

It reads a little silly, but you just have to remember that `and` just checks
if every item is true, and here the `do` notation semantics are to compare each
`allowed` and `amount` point-wise, first the red-by-red, then the
green-by-green, and then the blue-by-blue.

Part 2 is a little simpler, we just need to aggregate the max per-color, and
then find the product:

```haskell
calcPower = product . foldr (liftA2 max) 0
```

where `liftA2 max (V3 x y z) (V3 a b c) = V3 (max x a) (max y b) (max z c)`,
and `0` for `V3` is `V3 0 0 0`.  And `product` works like how you'd think.

Going back to parsing, one neat way we can leverage `V3` is with its `Functor`
instance:

```
-- [("red", 1), ("green", 2), ("blue", 6)]
pairUp :: [(String, Int)] -> V3 Int
pairUp pairs = do
    color <- V3 "red" "green" "blue"
    pure $ fromMaybe 0 (lookup color pairs)
```

This performs an action per-color and fills in the spot with the result of
`lookup`, with `0` if the lookup fails.
