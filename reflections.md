This year's day 1 was definitely a little spicier than most!  But Haskell's
stream processing works well for us, again.

First let's get a nice utility function to make a number the first and last
seen digit:

```haskell
firstAndLast :: [Int] -> Int
firstAndLast xs = head xs * 10 + last xs
```

And now we have to figure out how to extract the digits from each part.  For
part 1, we need only to extract all of the `isDigit` characters:

```haskell
extract1 :: String -> [Int]
extract1 = map digitToInt . filter isDigit
```

For part 2, it's a little bit trickier: we can look at each position and see if
it is a new number string:

```haskell
extract2 :: String -> [Int]
extract2 = mapMaybe isNumberString . tails
  where
    isNumberString :: String -> Maybe Int
    isNumberString str = listToMaybe
      [ d
      | (numStr, d) <-
          [ ("one",1), ("two",2), ("three",3)
          , ("four",4), ("five",5), ("six",6)
          , ("seven",7), ("eight",8), ("nine",9)
          ]
      | numStr `isPrefixOf` str
      ]
```

Note that `tails` is a function that takes `"abc"` and returns
`["abc","bc","c"]`, allowing us to look at each position in order.

And that gives us the solutions:

```haskell
day01 :: (String -> [Int]) -> String -> Int
day01 extractor = sum . map (sum . extractor) . lines

day01a = day01 extract1
day01b = day01 extract2
```

This one was definitely a bit too heavy on the parsing side heh. But maybe the
more interesting Haskell insight would be that we can use a nice data type --
`V3` from the *linear* library (`data V3 a = V3 a a a`) to make the actual
solving logic very simple.  I've always held that `V2` and `V3` are pretty much
some of the most useful non-standard data types for advent of code, and they
were pretty helpful today.  They have the most convenient `Num`, `Functor`,
`Applicative`, `Foldable`, and `Traversable` instances!

If we encode each "set" as `V3 <red> <green> <blue>`, then the filters and
checksums become very simple.

For part 1, we need to see if all `V3 Int`s in a line are legal.  We can
implement that as `all isLegal`:

```hasell
isLegal :: V3 Int -> Bool
isLegal colorVec = and do
  allowed <- V3 12 13 14
  amount <- colorVec
  pure (amount <= allowed)
```

It reads a little silly, but you just have to remember that `and` just checks
if every item is true, and here the `do` notation semantics are to compare each
`allowed` and `amount` point-wise, first the red-by-red, then the
green-by-green, and then the blue-by-blue.

Part 2 is a little simpler, we just need to aggregate the max per-color, and
then find the product:

```haskell
calcPower = product . foldr (liftA2 max) 0
```

where `liftA2 max (V3 x y z) (V3 a b c) = V3 (max x a) (max y b) (max z c)`,
and `0` for `V3` is `V3 0 0 0`.  And `product` works like how you'd think.

Going back to parsing, one neat way we can leverage `V3` is with its `Functor`
instance:

```
-- [("red", 1), ("blue", 2), ("green", 6)] => V3 1 6 2
pairUp :: [(String, Int)] -> V3 Int
pairUp pairs = do
    color <- V3 "red" "green" "blue"
    pure $ fromMaybe 0 (lookup color pairs)
```

This performs an action per-color and fills in the spot with the result of
`lookup`, with `0` if the lookup fails.
